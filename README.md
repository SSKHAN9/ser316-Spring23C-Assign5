Design Pattern Plans:

I plan to use the composite design pattern to group the animal objects into a single object.

I plan to use the builder pattern to create farms and assign different attributes to each farm.

I will be using the suggestion to use the mediator pattern to create ticks, where currency will be generated along with keeping track of animal tasks and growing crops.
